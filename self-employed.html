									<h1 class="news-title"><span>Self-Employment Tax :</span> Definition, How It Works, and How to File </h1>
									<p>
										<span>Self-employment tax is the payment that self-employed people and small business owners owe the federal 
											government to fund Medicare and Social Security. It is paid in lieu of the usual payment by employers of 
											their share of their employees</span>
									</p>
									<!-- End Title -->
									<p class="p-margin">
										Many people have dreams of being self-employed, but you’re different: You actually have a shot at it. You have 
										the start-up capital and a solid business plan that will help make your dream a reality. But before you take 
										your first step into the world of entrepreneurship, there’s a checklist of things you’ll need to do if you 
										don’t want to get nailed by tax problems while your venture is still in its infancy.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>How the Self-Employment Tax Works</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										The self-employment tax is collected from workers who earn income but don't pay withholding taxes through 
										an employer. This includes sole proprietors, freelancers, and independent contractors who carry on a 
										trade or business. A member of a partnership that carries on a trade or business may also be considered to be 
										self-employed. Self-employed individuals must pay self-employment tax as a condition of receiving Social Security 
										benefits upon retirement
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										In any business, both the company and the employee are taxed to pay for the two major social welfare programs: 
										Medicare and Social Security. In the eyes of the IRS, individuals who are self-employed are considered both the 
										company and the employee, which is why they must pay both portions of this tax.

									<p class="text">Unlike employees who have taxes withheld from their paychecks, self-employed individuals are generally required to make quarterly estimated tax payments to cover their income tax and self-employment tax liabilities. These payments help ensure that taxes are paid throughout the year rather than in one lump sum at the end.</p>

									<p class="text">Self-employed individuals are subject to self-employment tax, which covers Social Security and Medicare contributions.

									<p class="p-margin-col">
										The self-employment tax is collected from workers who earn income but don't pay withholding taxes through 
										an employer. This includes sole proprietors, freelancers, and independent contractors who carry on a 
										trade or business. A member of a partnership that carries on a trade or business may also be considered to be 
										self-employed. Self-employed individuals must pay self-employment tax as a condition of receiving Social Security 
										benefits upon retirement
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Self-Employment Tax Rates</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										Social Security tax is assessed at a rate of 6.2% for an employer and 6.2% for the employee. Therefore, a 
										self-employed worker is taxed 12.4% (6.2% + 6.2%) as they are considered to be both an employer and an employee.
										The Social Security tax is applied only to the first $160,200 of self-employment income earned in 2023. 
										That amount increases for 2024 when it will be applied to the first $168,600 of income. Medicare tax is 
										assessed at a rate of 1.45% for an employer and 1.45% for the employee. Therefore, a self-employed worker is 
										taxed 2.9% (1.45% + 1.45%) as they are considered to be both an employer and an employee.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										Self-employment tax is a tax-deductible expense. While the tax is charged on a taxpayer’s business profit, the IRS 
										lets them count the employer half of the self-employment tax, or 7.65% (calculated as half of 15.3%), as a business 
										deduction for purposes of calculating that taxpayer's income tax.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Special Considerations</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										People who are self-employed aren't subject to automatic tax withholding from an employer. Therefore, quarterly 
										estimated tax payments are required to cover their federal and state income taxes as well as the FICA taxes.
										The deferred payments for a portion of self-employment taxes, included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
										and Economic Security (CARES) Act, have expired. The act deferred payment of the employer portion of 
										self-employment taxes attributable to Social Security for the period from March 27, 2020, through Dec. 
										31, 2020. It deferred payment of 50% of those taxes until Dec. 31, 2021, and the other 50% until Dec. 
										31, 2024.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										High-income earners face an additional self-employment tax. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) earnings 
										above $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly) are subject to an additional 0.9% Medicare tax.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Social Security Tax on My Side Gig</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										If you make at least $400 a year in a side job, you owe Social Security and Medicare taxes, known jointly as 
										FICA taxes. So, if you run a small store on Etsy.com, or do odd jobs for the neighbors in your spare time, 
										you will be taxed on your side income above $400 a year.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>FICA Taxes Gone Up in Recent Years</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										The current Social Security tax rate of 6.2% has been in place since 1990. The last real change in the tax rate 
										on Medicare came with the Affordable Care Act of 2010, which increased the Medicare tax for high earners by 
										0.9% to pay for the expansion of health insurance access.

							<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
							<p>
								People who are self-employed receive Social Security payments when they retire, even if they never have worked 
								for an employer who deducted the taxes for those payments from their paychecks. Instead, they pay their own way,

									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>How the Self-Employment Tax Works</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										The self-employment tax is collected from workers who earn income but don't pay withholding taxes through 
										an employer. This includes sole proprietors, freelancers, and independent contractors who carry on a 
										trade or business. A member of a partnership that carries on a trade or business may also be considered to be 
										self-employed. Self-employed individuals must pay self-employment tax as a condition of receiving Social Security 
										benefits upon retirement
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Know your entity</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										One of the most important decisions you must make as you start your journey toward self-employment is 
										determining what your business structure will be. Whether your company will be a sole proprietorship, an LLC, 
										a partnership, an S-corporation, or C-corporation will affect how your taxable income flows through to your 
										personal tax return.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Partnerships and Corporations</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										If you have a business partner, you will likely file as either a partnership or as a corporation. A partnership 
										must file an information return, but it typically does not pay federal income tax. Information returns are tax 
										documents (the most common being Form W-2) that businesses and taxpayers must file to report certain business 
										transactions to the Internal Revenue Service. Usually, you use Form K-1 to report an individual's share of 
										partnership and S-corporation income to the federal government.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										Unlike a sole proprietorship or a partnership, a C-corporation is recognized as a separate tax-paying entity for 
										federal tax purposes. That means the corporation may be able to take special deductions. It also means the profit 
										it earns is taxed at the corporate level, then taxed again on the recipient's tax return if it is distributed as 
										a dividend to shareholders.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										We are similar to partnerships in that the income typically flows through to your personal tax return. But they are 
										like C-corporations in that you normally set a salary and withhold payroll taxes at the corporate level for the owner. 
										Some or all of your income may be reported to you at the end of the year.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										One of the advantages of being an S-corporation is the taxpayer’s ability to choose a salary, subject to reasonable 
										guidelines. But there can be serious tax ramifications should a person severely underpay himself when the business 
										is making money, because wages are subject to payroll taxes. Although an LLC is a legal business structure, 
										it is a state-level designation that is not generally recognized for federal tax purposes. It must file as a 
										corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Get ready for taxes</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										Now that you know what you are, you can take the steps that can lead to tax deductions down the road. That may 
										first involve securing a tax ID number. If you can carve out a little nook in your home that you can dedicate 
										solely to your business affairs, you’re setting yourself up for a great home office tax deduction. It does not 
										have to be a separate room, as a desk in the corner of the kitchen will qualify. But it does have to be used 
										exclusively for business tasks, so the kitchen table probably does not qualify. If you’ve never been a stickler 
										about keeping track of the money you earn and spend, now is the time to make it part of your daily routine.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Cruise into tax deductions</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										One of the most common tax deductions self-employed taxpayers can claim is automobile expenses. So don’t fret 
										over the steadily depreciating value of that new van you purchased to make deliveries for your catering business. 
										Several tax options can help you recoup some of the money you spend maintaining and using your car for 
										business-related purposes. To get the maximum deductions for your business vehicle, you must maintain a 
										written log of business miles. You must also jot down your odometer reading at the beginning and end of each 
										year so you’ll know your total miles. You may choose to use the standard mileage rates set by the federal government 
										or deduct the actual expenses. If your car is over 6,000 pounds gross weight, you are not likely subject to the 
										luxury rules and therefore can get a higher deduction for depreciation or your lease payments. All expenses 
										must be ‘ordinary and necessary’ to deduct.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>A new responsibility</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										With the freedom of being a self-employed individual comes the sole responsibility for paying taxes. In addition to 
										income taxes, you may be required to collect and pay sales tax, a state-mandated surcharge that varies from state 
										to state. Business owners should check with their state government to see if they must charge customers sales tax 
										for their products or services. If you should have collected taxes and don’t, then you can be personally liable 
										on the sales tax you should have collected but didn’t. Individuals may also be held responsible for a use tax, 
										which is applied to all the items a person buys for the business and should have paid sales tax on but didn’t. Whether
										you file as a sole proprietor, partnership or a corporation, individuals often have to pay estimated federal and 
										state taxes on profits from the business. And finally, if you have employees on your payroll, including yourself, 
										they and you are required to pay Uncle Sam the standard payroll taxes on salaries. Let a local tax expert matched 
										to your unique situation get your taxes done 100% right with TurboTax Live Full Service. Your expert will uncover 
										industry-specific deductions for more tax breaks and file your taxes for you. Backed by our Full Service Guarantee.
