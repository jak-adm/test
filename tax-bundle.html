									<p>
										<span>A bundled transaction is the retail sale of two or more products in which products are distinct and identifiable 
											and the products are sold for one non-itemized price. The reason this matters to businesses is that, 
											if a bundled transaction includes a taxable product, then the entire transaction could become taxable. </span>
									</p>
									<!-- End Title -->
									<p class="p-margin">
										“Products” recognized for the purpose of a bundled transaction include tangible personal property, services, 
										intangibles, digital goods, and other products on which sales tax may be charged in a retail sale which may vary 
										from state to state. However, “products” excluded from consideration are real property and services to real property. 
										Examples of services to real property include building framing, roofing, plumbing, electrical, painting, janitorial, 
										pest control, and window cleaning.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Two or More Products Distinct and Identifiable Products</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin">
										If items are included in a state’s definition of sales price or purchase price, then a retail sale may not be 
										considered to consist of “two or more distinct and identifiable products.” For example, a delivery service charge 
										in connection with the sale of a good will constitute a single sales price in many states.

									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>What needs to know</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin">
										Many CSPs utilize strategic bundling to maintain a competitive edge. Emerging trends and fast-paced innovation are 
										driving constant change, leading to a steady drip of new voice, video, and tech offerings. The associated tax 
										complexity involved with bundling these services is challenging, especially for new players entering the space, 
										but can be addressed with proper documentation, planning, and coordination with marketing teams.  Bundling goods 
										and/or services is common marketing practice in many industries, recognizing customers perceive (and receive) 
										greater value when items are offered in a package. Communications service providers (CSPs) have been doing this 
										for decades, at least since the advent of local and long-distance services. 
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>What does have to do with this </span></p>
									<p class="p-margin">
										Bundling is not a new concept. As mentioned above, CSPs have been doing this for years, but they’re far from the 
										first to bundle. At the turn of the 20th century, a retailer in New York began selling a package of goods that 
										included cheese, a board, and a knife for a single price. In New York, food items are tax exempt; however, 
										the other items were not. The New York cheese board rule leads to the conclusion that although cheese was the 
										“star” as the main item in the package and tax exempt, the entire package or bundle must still be assessed for 
										sales tax. This case aptly illustrates the complexity that comes with bundling communication services. 
										More important, it set the precedent that an entire bundle must be taxed if a customer is not privy to 
										seeing the disaggregated prices for each individual good or service.  
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span> Does modern communications bundles so complicated to tax ?</span></p>	
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										While there are numerous varieties of cheese, at the end of the day cheddar and manchego most likely fall under the 
										same regulatory rules and tax rates. When it comes to communications services, the rules and rates tend to be more 
										diverse and complicated. A wireless or cable bundle might include any mix of voice, text, or data. 
										Each service has its own very complex calculation and must be able to be both billed and reported accurately, 
										regardless of how the bundle is marketed as a unit.
										<p class="p-margin-col">
											As consumer demand drives increased need for more data intensive offerings with less focus on traditional voice, 
											we continue to see industry consolidation and frequent pricing changes as providers struggle to remain competitive. 
											This makes managing bundled pricing and the necessary record keeping behind it incredibly difficult. However, 
											from a marketing perspective, it’s an absolute necessity.
										</p>
										<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Needs to know the books and records rules</span></p>
										<p class="p-margin-col">
											Many states don’t take as hard of a line as New York does with the cheese board rule, instead allowing sellers 
											to “unbundle the bundle” for tax purposes so long as they can show the work behind their math.  By producing 
											documentation showing the standalone, or disaggregated, price for each component within a bundle, CSPs can avoid 
											taxing the entire bundle at the rate of the highest item.  
										</p>	
										<p class="p-margin-col">
											Managing this level of record keeping can be challenging when prices change on a weekly basis, or when prices 
											are unavailable because the item isn’t sold on its own. CSPs have to change pricing in bundles, as well as the 
											individual SKUs throughout their records to remain compliant. This is often a joint effort between marketing, 
											tax, IT, and even external vendors.
										</p>	
										
										<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Tips for the Taxpayer</span></p>
										<p class="p-margin-col">
											From a business perspective, bundled transactions can make sense in order to appropriately advertise and sell products as well as to increase revenue. Also, bundled transactions can reduce the administrative burden of itemizing each product in a sale and separately determining and applying sales tax. As such, there are numerous factors especially in complex commercial transactions where bundling makes sense.
											The best approach then is to be knowledgeable about how each item would be taxed separately as a product (whether good or service) which does vary greatly by state. This base knowledge will allow you to create various combinations of goods and services and then apply the outlined 5-step process for review in a streamlined manner. There are a limited number of bundle categories which may require closer scrutiny such as those involving taxable digital services as well as warranty, repair and service contracts. However, in those bundled transaction types which are most often encountered by businesses, the above approach will provide clarity as a guiding tool.

										<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Bottom line on bundling</span></p>
										<p class="p-margin-col">
											It’s imperative for CSPs to fully understand the tax implications when bundling. Here are a few tips to keep in mind to help remain compliant in an intensely competitive environment driven by consumer preference and rapid innovation
										</p>
										<p class="p-margin-col">
											Maintaining compliance in order to avoid unexpected or unknown liabilities should be a top priority. The consequences are dire and can make or break a company, whether that be falling behind competitors able to offer better-value services, financial implications from fines, or damage to reputation.
										</p>
										<p class="p-margin-col">
											Moving forward, as complexity is certain to increase even more, knowing how to document bundle components will be key to meeting challenges. However, with the landscape changing so quickly, it’s also critical to stay in the know on new developments and quickly pivot
