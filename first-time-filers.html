									<h1 class="news-title"> To file taxes for the <span>first time</span></h1>
									<p><span>
										Mortgages, retirement funds, tax returns — these are strictly adult concerns, right? Hold on to your smart phones 
										because the reality may shock you. If you’re making money, you may have to pay income tax. For example, 
										if you’re a teen, you’re still considered a minor in almost every respect, but the government will treat you 
										like full-fledged adult when it comes to federal income taxes.
										</span>
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin">
										If you’re a first-time filer, it may seem intimidating to take on this responsibility. Don’t worry. We’re here to help and break it all down for you. Let’s go step by step for your first-time filing taxes.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Know if you’ll need to file</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin">
										If you can be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer’s return and you’ve had a job — even a part-time one 
										— and earned more than $12,950 in the tax year—you’ll need to file. Alternatively, if you didn’t have a job but 
										made more than $1,150 on unearned income (e.g., interest from investments), you will also be required to file. 
										If you don’t fall into either category and area dependent, you are likely not required to file a federal tax return.
										However, if you did work and had taxes withheld, filing a return is the only way to get a tax refund. Plus, it’ll 
										serve as a lesson for filing taxes in the future. We recommend doing it.

									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Income tax forms</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										These include W-2s, 1099s and other forms reporting any kind of income. Remember that the IRS wants to 
										know about all of your income, including your side gigs, bonuses and interest income (such as from your 
										high-yield savings account, which will send you a 1099-INT form if you’ve earned more than $10 in interest).
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Deductions</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										These are the things that can lower your tax bill and add to your refund. For example, if you’re a student, 
										you may be eligible for deductions—your school will notify you of qualifying costs by sending you a Form 1098-T. 
										You can also deduct interest you paid on your student loan. Or, if you’re a freelancer and working from a home 
										office, you might get the home office deduction. However, it might make more sense for you to go for a 
										standard deduction. A standard deduction is a flat amount the IRS allows you to subtract from your income 
										instead of adding up all of your deductible expenses. The amount typically changes every year to account for 
										inflation. For example, this year, if you’re single or filing separately,
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										To make sure you’re deducting as much as you can—and that should be your goal, just keep your deductions 
										honest—sum up itemized deductions and see if they’ll turn out to be more than the standard deduction. If not, 
										don’t itemize, because the standard deduction will save you more money. Note that if you’re itemizing deductions, 
										you need to be able to prove your expenses. This means being organized and keeping receipts so you can prove to 
										the IRS your return is truthful. Another awesome thing you might be able to do when filing taxes this year is 
										claim your stimulus check if you missed one (or both). You can do so using a Recovery Rebate Credit on 2020 Form 
										1040 or Form 1040-SR when filing your federal tax return.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>See if you can be claimed as a dependent</span></p>	
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										Last but not the least, talk to your parents to see if they’re claiming you as a dependent on their taxes this year. 
										This can be the case if you still live with them or they offer substantial financial help. You’ll still have to 
										file your taxes, but your parents will get certain tax benefits. Additionally, you’ll need to indicate that you 
										may be claimed as dependent on someone else’s return when you file.

										One of the most popular ways to do your taxes is to file online. With services like TurboTax and H&R Block, 
										you can file for free if your tax situation is simple or pay for one of the premium packages to get access 
										to extra features and help from tax specialists. You can also check free e-file options from the IRS. Using 
										these tools is comparatively easy. They guide the process by asking you simple questions and filling out your 
										state and federal returns for you. You can even take pictures of your forms and upload them to have your 
										info entered automatically. Once you’re done, the tool will calculate the maximum possible refund and 
										file your taxes for you. See, it’s not that scary!
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Filing with a tax pro</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										For the last couple of years, my taxes have been more complicated than I’d like them to be. I moved states, 
										switched jobs, changed my filing status, didn’t receive my first stimulus check and so on. I took a stab at 
										filing online for free but ended up with many questions and a migraine. So, I just let someone who knows what 
										they’re doing handle it for me; I made an appointment with a tax professional. There’s nothing wrong with having 
										a specialist do your taxes if your tax situation is a bit more complex. Of course, you’ll have to pay a fee, 
										which varies by the tax preparer and complexity of your taxes. It can be a certified public accountant, attorney 
										or enrolled agent—just make sure the person is qualified by checking their credentials. Many people 
										also use H&R Block for filing with a tax professional. If you’re looking for an affordable option, 
										look into your local credit unions which may offer low-cost tax preparation services. If you’re still a student, 
										there’s another great option for you. Many college and university campuses will provide tax preparation services 
										for students with the assistance of other students who may be looking to gain experience working under a 
										qualified supervisor in a tax lab,” says Jeffrey Wood, CPA and partner at Lift Financial. “These labs are 
										usually located in the business departments, may be free depending on your institution, and may be worth 
										looking into for tax filing assistance.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Filing your taxes by hand</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										Who’s still doing their taxes manually, especially when it’s their first time. You’d have to fill out Form 1040 
										or Form 1040-SR by hand and use a calculator to add up all your income and deductions. Then you’d have to mail 
										the form and wait for six to eight weeks for the IRS to process your return. There’s no reason for anyone to 
										choose this route. When there are services that allow you to file online for free, why would you go so old-school?

									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Paying with your bank account</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										This is your best option because this way you’ll avoid any fees. Plus, the IRS will have your account 
										information on file for refunds and awesome things like stimulus checks. People who pay directly from their 
										bank account can count on the quickest process—and the fastest refund if you’re owed one. “When you file with 
										direct deposit, you can see your refund in as soon as one week, compared to filing with a check in the mail, 
										which can take up to eight weeks,” a Chase representative told me. “E-filing with direct deposit is easy, 
										you just need to find your account and routing numbers.”
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin-col"><span>Paying with a card</span></p>
									<p class="p-margin-col">
										You can also pay your taxes with a debit or credit card, but keep in mind that there will be fees involved. If you 
										ask me, it doesn’t really make sense to pay with your debit card—just use your bank account linked to your 
										debit card instead to avoid the processing fee and get all the benefits that come with the direct deposit. As for 
										whether it’s a good idea to pay with a credit card, it depends. There’s also a fee, but if you’re working toward 
										earning your sign-up bonus, it may be worth it. I know some hardcore credit card enthusiasts who once overpaid 
										their taxes to get a bonus, knowing the IRS would refund them. Do the math to see if that makes sense in your 
										case and make sure you can pay off the debt right away to avoid losing money to your card’s interest

										There is a way to know if you’ll owe money or get a tax refund. In the simplest terms possible, if you paid more 
										taxes than the government requires, then you’ll get a refund check in the mail or via direct deposit. On the other 
										hand, if you come up short on what you’re required to pay, then you’ll owe taxes. To determine how much you’re 
										paying in taxes on each paycheck, look at your paystub. That thing called “withholding” is directly related to 
										your money and the amount taken out of your paycheck. The more you withhold, the more money taken out of your 
										paycheck. It’ll result in less money on your paychecks, but a better chance of receiving a refund. Withhold less 
										and your paychecks will be heftier — but your chances of owing money come tax season will also rise. You can 
										use our W-4 paycheck tax calculator to estimate your refund or tax due based on your current W-4 form; 
										this can give you a better idea of whether you are claiming the right number of exemptions for your tax situation.
