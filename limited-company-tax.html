									<h1 class="news-title">Corporate - <span>taxes</span> on corporate income </h1>
									<p>
										<span>Resident companies are taxable in the United Kingdom on their worldwide profits (subject to an opt-out for 
											non-UK PEs), while non-resident companies are subject to UK corporation tax on the trading profits attributable 
											to a UK PE, the trading profits attributable to a trade of dealing in or developing UK land (irrespective of 
											whether there is a UK PE), on gains on the direct and certain indirect disposals of UK property, together with 
											the dividend exemption, makes the UK corporation tax system more like a territorial system.</span>
									</p>
									<h2 class="head-margin-col">General corporation tax rates</h2>
									<p class="p-margin">
										Where the taxable profits can be attributed to the exploitation of patents, a lower effective rate of tax applies. 
										The rate is 10%. Profits can include a significant part of the trading profit from the sales of a product that 
										includes a patent, not just income from patent royalties.
									</p>
									<h2 class="head-margin-col">Special corporation tax regimes</h2>	
									<p class="p-margin">
										Apart from the six specific exceptions noted below, there are no special regimes for particular types or sizes 
										of business activity; in general, all companies in all sectors are subject to the same corporation tax rates and 
										rules. However, certain treatments and reliefs do vary according to size, including transfer pricing, R&D credits, 
										and some targeted anti-avoidance rules.
										<p class="p-margin">
											For large companies, there are some additional compliance and reporting requirements. Some elements of HMRC’s 
											organisational structure and approach to avoidance and compliance are arranged by size of business (e.g. Large 
											Business Strategy).
										</p>
									<h4 class="head4">Tonnage Tax regime</h4>
									<p class="p-margin">
										Companies that are liable to corporation tax and operate qualifying ships that are strategically and commercially 
										managed in the United Kingdom can elect (subject to certain conditions) to apply Tonnage Tax in the place of 
										corporation tax. Tonnage Tax is an alternative method of calculating corporation tax profits by reference to the net 
										tonnage of operated ships. The Tonnage Tax profit replaces the tax-adjusted profit/loss on a shipping business and 
										certain related activities, as well as the chargeable gains/losses made on Tonnage Tax assets. Any other profits are 
										taxable under the normal corporation tax regime.
									</p>

										</div>
									</div>
									<p class="p-margin">
										A Tonnage Tax election must, broadly, be made within 12 months from the day that the company became eligible to 
										enter the regime. However, in the 2023 Budget, the government announced a new window for entry into the Tonnage 
										Tax regime for eligible companies from 1 June 2023 to 30 November 2024. This election window was implemented by a 
										Statutory Instrument made on 9 May 2023. Other changes to the Tonnage Tax regime were announced in Budget 2023 with 
										effect from 1 April 2024, which will be legislated for in Finance Bill 2024.
									</p>
									<h4 class="head4">Banking sector</h4>
									<p class="p-margin">
										A supplementary tax is applicable to companies in the banking sector at 3% on profits in excess of GBP 100 million 
										with effect for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 April 2023. Prior to this date, the rate of supplementary 
										corporate tax charge was 8% on profits above GBP 100 million. 
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin">		
										Loss utilisation is restricted; pre-1 April 2015 carried forward trading losses can be set against only 25% of 
										profits in a period, and post-1 April 2015 carried forward trading losses are subject to the general loss 
										restriction.
									</p>
									<h4 class="head4">Real estate investment trust (REIT) regime</h4>
									<p class="p-margin">
										A UK REIT is, broadly, a UK resident company or a group of companies of which the principal company is UK tax 
										resident carrying on a property investment business, with property let to third-party tenants. Subject to the 
										satisfaction of a number of conditions, REITs are taxed under a special regime.  
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin">
										A UK REIT is exempt from UK tax on both rental income and gains relating to its qualifying property rental business, 
										and, since 6 April 2019, gains on the sale of shares in qualifying UK property-rich companies. 

										Profits from activities of the REIT other than the property rental business (the ‘residual business’) are subject 
										to corporation tax in the normal way.
									</p>
									
									<p class="p-margin">
										The QAHC regime was introduced with effect from April 2022 in order to mitigate the tax road blocks that prevent 
										the use of a UK company to act as a holding company/intermediate holding company.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin">
										A QAHC must be at least 70% owned by diversely owned funds managed by regulated managers, or certain institutional 
										investors, and exists to facilitate the flow of capital, income, and gains between investors and underlying investments.
										There are a number of detailed provisions relating to the regime, but broadly, in terms of the benefits, it is allowed 
										tax exemption/benefits.
									</p>
									<h4 class="head4">Residential Property Developer Tax (RPDT)</h4>
									<p class="p-margin">
										A UK RPDT has been introduced with effect from 1 April 2022. It applies to a company or corporate group that holds 
										or has held interests in land/property as trading stock in the course of a trade and is subject to corporation tax on 
										trading profits from residential property development activity. The tax applies at a rate of 4% to annual profits 
										exceeding GBP 25 million (on a group basis, where relevant).
									</p>
									<h2 class="head-margin-col">Special corporation tax regimes</h2>
									<p class="p-margin">
										A non-resident company is subject to UK corporation tax on the trading profits of a UK PE and, irrespective of 
										whether there is a UK PE, the trading profits attributable to a trade of dealing in or developing UK land, as well 
										as profits from a UK property rental business. Non-resident companies are also subject to UK corporation tax on 
										gains on the direct and certain indirect disposals of UK property 
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin">
										Any other UK-source income received by a non-resident company is subject to UK income tax at the basic rate, 
										currently 20%, without any allowances (subject to any relief offered by a double tax treaty [DTT], if applicable). 
										This charge has most commonly arisen in relation to UK rental income earned by a corporate non-resident 
										landlord (NRL), which, until 5 April 2020, was within the scope of UK income tax. The United Kingdom operates 
										an NRL scheme that requires the NRL's letting agent or tenants to withhold income tax at 20% at source unless 
										they have been notified that the NRL has applied for and been given permission to receive gross rents. The NRL 
										scheme is continuing, notwithstanding that corporate NRLs are now within the scope of corporation tax in respect 
										of the profits of their property rental business (see ‘Non-resident companies within corporation tax on UK 
										property rental business income.
									</p>
									<h2 class="head-margin-col">Diverted Profits Tax (DPT)</h2>
									<p class="p-margin">
										DPT, introduced in April 2015, is part of the United Kingdom’s response to the shifting tax environment, most 
										notably highlighted in the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) reports. DPT is separate from other 
										corporate taxes. The usual rate of DPT charged on diverted profits (as defined) was increased from 25% to 31% 
										from 1 April 2023, with apportionment provisions for accounting periods straddling the commencement date. This 
										increase was made in order to maintain the differential between the rate of DPT and corporation tax, which was 
										also increased by 6% from that date. The rate of DPT charged on diverted profits that are UK ring-fenced profits 
										or notional ring-fence profits (broadly oil extraction operations) remains 55%. The rate of DPT charged on taxable 
										diverted profits that would have been subject to the bank surcharge remains unchanged at 33%.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin">
										Companies are required to notify HMRC if they are potentially within the scope of DPT (even if it is anticipated 
										that there will be no DPT payable, e.g. due to credit relief) within three months of the end of the accounting 
										period to which the notification would relate. The legislation is complex and subjective in places, and it has the 
										potential to apply more widely than might be expected.
									</p>
									<p class="p-margin">
										Finance Act 2022 (FA22) introduced three changes to the rules. It inserted a new subsection (101C FA2015) that 
										provides that a final closure notice may not be issued in relation to an open enquiry where the review period for 
										a DPT charging notice remains open. This is clearly a response to the First-tier Tribunal (FTT) decision in Vitol 
										Aviation Ltd v HMRC, in which the FTT found that HMRC was in possession of sufficient information on the transfer 
										pricing aspects to close their corporation tax enquiries and despite the DPT review period still being open, the 
										FTT directed HMRC to close their corporation tax enquiries. This is an important immediate change to the 
										legislation, resulting in DPT still being the 'stick' to encourage the resolution of transfer pricing disputes. 
										This change has effect in relation to any relevant tribunal direction that is given on or after 27 October 2021, 
										unless the application for the direction was made before 27 September 2021.
